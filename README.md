## Three Favourite Java Program Solutions

### Search String

**Description:** This program allows the user to input an x amount of strings in an array. Then asks the user for a string to be searched and outputs the location of that target string in the array.

**Explaination:** The program asks the user for the size of the array, the variable that stores the number is used to help create the array. Next, a for loop allows the user to input all the strings into the array for the specified size. After that, the programs asks the user for a target word to be searched. Another for loop is created to search through the array, nested inside is a if statement, if one of the iterations matches the target word, the location is stored in a variable and the loop is broken. Lastly, an if statement, the first condition is if it is equal to -1, there is no match, else there is one and the location is printed out.
